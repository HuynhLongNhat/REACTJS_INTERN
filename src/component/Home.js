            <h3>Creating and nesting components</h3>
            <p>  React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.
                React components are JavaScript functions that return markup:</p>
        </div>
    </>);
